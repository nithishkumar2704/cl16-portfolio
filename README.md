## 🏁 Overview
This project is a high-fidelity **Personal Portfolio Website** designed for F1 Driver Charles Leclerc.  
It moves away from traditional "image-heavy" sports sites and embraces a **Typographic & Data-Driven** aesthetic (Swiss Style).

**The Vibe:** Dark, Expensive, Technical.  
**The Goal:** To create a digital experience that feels like a high-performance dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features

### 2. ⚡ Features & Modules
- **Create Countdown:** A live "Race Center" widget counting down to the **Monaco Grand Prix 2026**.
- **Typographic Shop:** A unique e-commerce section that uses **Design & Data** (icons, specs) instead of product photos.
- **Interactive Timeline:** A "Journey" section tracing his path from Karting (2005) to Ferrari.
- **Career Stats:** High-density bento grid showing Wins, Poles, and Podiums.
